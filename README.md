**BIBLIO

App created while in 4th week as student at MakerSquare.  Uses Bootstrap.  After creating an account through Devise, users can add book information to a library.  If a user inputs an ISBN, the app uses the Goodreads API to pull in information for any blank columns, including title, description, author, and thumbnail of book, displayed on show view.
